# NAS Posit Benchmark

An extension of the NAS benchmark suite https://github.com/benchmark-subsetting/NPB3.0-omp-C to use differerent precision for computation. each folder represents a different version using a different precision: quad, double, float, posit32 and quire32. The benchmark suite includes CG, FT, MG, BT and LU, quire32 does not implement BT and LU. This code is for prototyping purpose only and is not thoroughly tested for production use!
